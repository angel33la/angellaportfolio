          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello! I'm Angella, however I usually go by Angie. I am a web developer and also a jack of many trades. Although, I have not been coding and designing websites for long, it is something I am very passionate about.  It has been such a wonderful expierence being able to be passionate about the things I am learning and also the projects I have been creating.</p>
          <p>In my free time you will catch me spending time with my one of my 7 cats. Never thought I would have as many cats as I do. However, once I got close to the ones I do have, it is hard to turn them away because they are now my family. I also love music concerts. I have an assortment of rock concerts I have been to and I have a list of my favorite artists that I have yet to see. So needless to say, there will be more to come.</p>
